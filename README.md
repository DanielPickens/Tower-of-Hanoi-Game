# Tower-of-Hanoi-Game
computes the demonstration of the tower of hanoi game from the numdiscs function. 


 we are reading the number of discs using ‘cnumdiscs’ variable. We are adding the function to Perform the movetower() function by passing ‘numdiscs’, 1, 3, 2 variable values as an argument.

The Tower of Hanoi is known as a mathematical puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top. We have to obtain the same stack on the third rod.

when we need to allow for the reading the number of discs using ‘cnumdiscs’ variable, we will perform the movetower() function by passing the numdiscs, 1, 3, 2 variable values as an argument. Once we allow for this use of the if condition statement , we the games automation function will check the condition if the value of ‘n’ variable is greater than 0. If the condition is true then the point of the game is to  execute the statement by moving the discs recursively.
